Tornado
=======
Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server
and and tools that power FriendFeed. Documentation and downloads are
available at http://www.tornadoweb.org/

Tornado is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

Automatic installation
----------------------

 Tornado is listed in PyPI and can be installed with pip or
easy_install. Note that the source distribution includes demo
applications that are not present when Tornado is installed in this
way, so you may wish to download a copy of the source tarball as well.

Manual installation
-------------------

Download https://github.com/downloads/facebook/tornado/tornado-2.3.tar.gz

    tar xvzf tornado-2.3.tar.gz
    cd tornado-2.3
    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

The Tornado source code is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/facebook/tornado

On Python 2.6 and 2.7, it is also possible to simply add the tornado
directory to your PYTHONPATH instead of building with setup.py, since
the standard library includes epoll support.

Prerequisites
-------------

Tornado runs on Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.2.

On Python 2.6 and 2.7, there are no dependencies outside the Python
standard library, although PycURL (version 7.18.2 or higher required;
version 7.21.1 or higher recommended) may be used if desired.

On Python 2.5, PycURL is required, along with simplejson and the
Python development headers (typically obtained by installing a package
named something like python-dev from your operating system).

On Python 3.2, the distribute package is required. Note that Python 3
support is relatively new and may have bugs.

Platforms
---------

 Tornado should run on any Unix-like platform, although for the best
performance and scalability only Linux and BSD (including BSD
derivatives like Mac OS X) are recommended.
